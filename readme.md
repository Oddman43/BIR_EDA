# BIR by the Numbers: My Study Journey in Data

## Why I did it

Last year I decided to go all-in for a spot as an Internal Resident of Biology (BIR).  
I was using the [Flowmodoro tool](https://github.com/Oddman43/Flowmodoro) to time-block my study sessions and log every focused minute, while Anki handled active recall. Thanks to [Anki Connect](https://git.sr.ht/~foosoft/anki-connect) I could also export every review timestamp.

The result: an 8-month sprint, studying every single day. I finished in the top 100… but only 50 spots were available.

My logged activities:

- **Lectures** – video lessons  
- **Bear Hunter System** – encoding framework from [i can study](https://www.icanstudy.com/)  
- **Active Recall** – periodic brain-dumps
- **Anki Craft** – creating new cards  
- **Anki Review** – reviewing cards  
- **Exam Questions** – official or mock tests

## Some funny numbers (Descriptive stats)

The total study time was 774.4 hours, with a mean of 3.4h per day and a median of 2.99 hours per day.

Most of my time was spent in the Bear Hunter System with 336h (aprox 45% of the time), followed by Exam questions with 140h and active recall with 117h.
